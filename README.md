# EPSM-analysis
Analyse submissions to EPSM meetings

The smallest start to a project to analyse and compare abstract submission patterns across EPSM meetings. 

Started for EPSM 2013 when we did all the abstract processing ourselves to save money & 
noticed an interesting pattern to submissions. 
People left them to the last minute, and even when the deadline was exteneded the majority were still submitted on the last day. 

A poster was presented at EPSM 2013 showing this and had a fair bit of interest. 
Tools for reproduceable research (and my understanding of it) have increased since then, 
so for EPSM 2019 I produced a poster using more modern tools, including GitHub and RMarkdown; specifically the posterdown package. 

The package/project is barely started, but hopefully will be expanded to a useful tool for other conferences in future.
